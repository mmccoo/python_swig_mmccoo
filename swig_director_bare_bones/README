This code is based the code in the swig tutorial:
http://www.swig.org/tutorial.html

it adds usage of director classes.

Using a director class enables you to use python callbacks from your c code.

You create a cpp class with some virtual methods. If you override any of those methods in
python, when your cpp code calls the virtual methods, the python override is executed.
